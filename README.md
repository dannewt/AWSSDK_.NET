Scripts &amp; Samples on how to use the AWS .NET SDK within a Unity Project

***REQUIRED***
Download the AWS .NET SDK from NuGet
If you are using addressable assets, you will need to create a link xml file similar for each service you plan to use
The services currently used here are S3, DyanmoDB, and SimpleEmail (check back for updates :))

The AWSManager Script shows basic uploading/downloading of information from the server, as well as a simple email service
that was used as a bug reporting feature.

The sample population script was used to populate a Unity GameObject with data stored in an AWS DynamoDB database.
